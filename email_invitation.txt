Dear {name},

First of all, thanks for being part of the Computational Methods division!

You are receiving this email because you volunteered to review for the Computational Methods group, or you submitted as first author to us, in which case we expect you to review as well.

As a reviewer, you can indicate which papers to review in a process known as 'paper bidding'.

We only just received the list of submissions from ICA, so unfortunately the time table is really tight. This year we have only time until Friday at noon ICA office time (EST) to assign reviews, so we will need your bid within the next 24 hours.

To do the paper bidding, please visit the link below:

We will assign all papers for review on Friday 13th. All reviews should be due by November 27th.

As always, this is a tight schedule, but since we will only be assigning a small amount of papers/abstracts we are confident that it should not be too much of a burden.

Happy bidding!

Annie Waldherr (vice-chair)
Cindy Shen (chair)
