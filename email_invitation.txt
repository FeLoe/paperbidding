Dear {name},

First of all, thanks for being part of the Computational Methods division

You are receiving this email because you volunteered to review for the
Computational Methods group, or you submitted as first author to us, in which case we expect
you to review as well.

As a reviewer, you can indicate which papers to review themselves in a process known as 'paper bidding'.

We only just got the list of submissions, so unfortunately the time table is
really tight: we will need your bid by Friday night (!).

To do the paper bidding, please visit the link below:

We will assign all papers for review by November 15th. All reviews should be due
by December 1st.

As always, this is a tight schedule, but since we will only be assigning a small
amount of papers/abstracts we are confident that it should not be too much of a burden.

Happy bidding!

Annie Waldherr (vice-chair)
Cindy Shen (chair)

PS As always, please mail us if you spot any bugs or have other feedback!
