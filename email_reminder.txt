Dear {name},

First of all, thanks for submitting to or volunteering for Computational Methods!

As you know, all authors who submit to CM are expected to also review, and we use a paper bidding system to
allow you to  pick papers you are interested in to review.

Unfortunately, ICA reviews work on a very tight time table, so we really need your bid by tomorrow noon, EU time (!).

Can you please take 5 minutes to go over the list of papers and mark at least 10 papers that you would be
interested in reviewing?

(If you already bid and I messed up the filter, sorry! You can just ignore this mail.)

So far, more than 100 people already bid on papers. If everyone chips in, we can be sure that no one
will have to review more than 2 or 3 abstracts or papers. The papers are sorted by relevance based on similarity
to your submission(s), so hopefully the most interesting papers will be near the top.

If you are really unwilling or unable to review, please send us an email, preferably with the name of a
co-author or someone else who can take over.

We will assign all papers for review on Friday 13th. All reviews should be due by November 27th.

As always, this is a tight schedule, but since we will only be assigning a small amount of papers/abstracts
we are confident that it should not be too much of a burden.

Happy bidding!
